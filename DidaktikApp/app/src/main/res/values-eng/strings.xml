    <string name="arkua">The "San Mamés" soccer field was built in 1913 and has undergone several expansions since then. In 1945, it was expanded, and a large iron arch was installed on the west stand. This arch became one of the distinctive features of the soccer field and the club itself. San Mamés field was demolished in 2013, but after some popular mobilizations, it was decided to preserve the arch. So they dismantled the arch, restored it, and moved it to the facilities that Athletic has in Lezama.</string>
